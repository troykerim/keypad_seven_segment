# keypad with seven segment on Zybo Z7-10

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of Digilentâ€™s Pmod Keypad and Seven Segment Display (SSD) with the Zybo Z7-10 FPGA board. The main objective is to capture user input from the keypad and display the corresponding value on the right-hand digit of the SSD. The implementation verifies correct keypad decoding and segment display control, serving as a foundational project for more advanced designs that require keypad-based input. This setup is ideal for developers seeking a starting point for user-interactive FPGA applications.
